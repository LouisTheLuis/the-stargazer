The Stargazer
=============
This is the project done for the class 6.148 (WebLab: A Web Programming Class and Competition) during the IAP 2022 term. It was made in collaboration with my friend **Eric Bui**.

The final website is given [here](http://the-stargazer.herokuapp.com/). Currently is suffering from some lack of functionality due to the images not working correctly (after all, the github repository for these images kinda changed). In the future, I plan to fix this, and maybe add some notes on the functionality of the website and the problems/pitfalls that it inevitably had (and which, for the time being, I don't plan to solve).
