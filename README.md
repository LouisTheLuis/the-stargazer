The Stargazer
=============
This is the project done for the class 6.148 (WebLab: A Web Programming Class and Competition) during the IAP 2022 term. It was made in collaboration with my friend **Eric Bui**.

The final website is given [here](http://the-stargazer.herokuapp.com/). Currently is suffering from some lack of functionality due to the images not working correctly (after all, the github repository for these images kinda changed). In the future, I plan to fix this, and maybe add some notes on the functionality of the website and the problems/pitfalls that it inevitably had (and which, for the time being, I don't plan to solve).

## Stargazer: A game to learn the constellations
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LouisTheLuis/the-stargazer/master/Images/Screenshot.png)

The idea behind Stargazer is the development of a game that can teach the player how to find constellations in the Boston sky. Through the use of a public API [Celestial Map using the D3.js visualization library](https://github.com/ofrohn/d3-celestial), we make the players interact with a moving map in order to find constellations and earn points in the process. The library of constellations is limited to the original 48 Greek constellations (with the exception of *Argo Navis*, which is no longer considered a single constellation). 

### Pages of the game and functionality
During the development of the game we brainstormed a couple of ideas and put everything together into four final pages:
* **Learning:** This is essentially a database of the 47 constellation that the game has. Each constellation includes the name, two pictures —one of the mythological representation, using Johann Bayer's paintings; and the other one from the constellation itself— of the constellations, and a brief description of the placement of the constellation and its mythology. The original ideas was to allow the players learn about the constellations (almost like clues) and to learn a little about their Greek origin.
* **Casual:** The casual mode would allow the player to endlessly practice finding constellations in the sky. The player is provided a map in which a selection rectangle can be drawn. The player must enclose the stars of the constellation in the rectangle and press *Submit* in order to go to the next constellation. In the case that the player misses, they can try again until it works —we have provided however, a functionality such that if you miss three times you are given the opportunity to skip to the next constellation. The game also contains a score, which counts the number of correct constellations you have obtained.
* **Competitive:** The competitive mode would provide the players up to 3 minutes (shown as 180 seconds) to find as many constellations as it is possible. The game in this situation also does not provide the player any picture of the constellation, thus increasing the difficulty. Internally, the game has a score of the amount of constellations obtained in the given timeframe.
* **Leaderboard:** This page would contain a leaderboard with all the best scores in the competitive mode; thus, allowing the users to try harder and find as many constellations as possible in 3 minutes!

### Issues
Even after we submitted this project for the WebLab competition, we ran into some issues that we were not able to fix during the timeframe given for the competition.
* **1.** The way the map internally works for the game, is that there is a CSS block overlapped over the map such that we make a translation from the pixel coordinates to map coordinates. Then, using the corners of the selection square, we determine the coordinates of these corners are *inside* the internal square for the constellation. We ran into a very simple problem however: using geographical coordinates, how do we account for constellations whose position in space runs over the 0°-360° line? How do we account for the fact that the coordinates *are cyclical*? Unfortunately, we did not solve this issue, and thus, multiple constellations are hardcoded to *only measure area of the selection rectangle*; thus, allowing some players to select the entire map (which should not be allowed) and still win.
* **2.** The leaderboard does not quite work in real time. It was hard to find a way such that when a player earns a high enough score in the Competitive mode, it immediately updates in the Leaderboard page. This issue has not been solved, and thus, the leaderboard page has been rendered essentially useless.
* **3.** The time counter for the Competitive mode does not work. JavaScript made it *really* hard for us to find a way to make the counter reset and to make it trigger with the *Start* button. In the end, once the counter gets to 0, it does not work (it displays NaN) and the player is stuck on the page; having to go back and enter again to reload the game.
* **4.** The CSS is *very* clunky. This is just an effect of the time crunch.
* **5.** The images are links from this repository in GitHub. So, if GitHub decides to change the URL for raw images again, essentially all of the constellation images will disappear from the page. We tried to see if we could upload the images to a DB but the whole process was too complicated to consider it.
